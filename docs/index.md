## About OxAI Labs
OxAI Labs is an independent and community-driven research team within the [Oxford Artificial Intelligence Society](http://oxai.org), 
which is a student-led society based at University of Oxford. 
The team seeks to promote social and environmental wellbeing through applications of technology. 

## Earth and Space Wildfire Project
From November 2019 to June 2020, we ran a project to analyse wildfire from satellite images and public datasets.

In the GitHub repository, we make our source code available so that other people who wish to pursue this direction of research
can benefit from the satellite image download tools, wildfire dataset parsing tools, and image visualising and labelling tools that we have developed.

In this GitHub page, we document features that we provide, highlight some of the challenges we faced, 
and discuss ethical and social responsibilities that should be addressed when conducting such research.
