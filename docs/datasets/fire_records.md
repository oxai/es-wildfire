# Ground Truth / Label Datasets

To label sattelite images as positive or negative (containing or not containing a wildfire) we needed a dataset detailing the occurence of wildfires.
At a minimum, such a dataset must give a time and a place at which there is a wildfire, but some datasets include shape files and more.

Below I outline some of the datasets we have considered, and whether or not they were suitable.


### FIRMS / MODIS + VIIRS

FIRMS (or Fire Information Resource Management System) is a NASA service for sharing information about active fire data.
The service uses data from images collected by the instruments: MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite).

#### METHOD?

Recent data is displayed on an interactive map: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/
We also requested data from the fire archives, to cross reference against the following source.


### 1.88 Million Wildfires / Kaggle
