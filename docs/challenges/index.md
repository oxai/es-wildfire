## Challenges of applying machine learning techniques to wildfire detection and prediction
Identifying and analysing wildfire using satellite images seems to be a simple and accomplishable task. 
However, it is also a task that has to be approached with caution, especially when it is taken as a machine learning problem.
Unlike problems of classifying cats and dogs, making a false-positive or false-negative fire prediction can have far more significant consequences.
Making future predictions requires even more consideration. 

Here, we list a number of challenges, difficulties and concerns we encountered throughout the project. 
We recognise that this is not a comprehensive list, and some concerns could be relieved by comprehensive data collection. 
We do not wish to discourage any future data-driven approaches to wildfire detection and prediction - on the contrary, 
we wish to encourage continual awareness and investigation into this serious issue. 
However, we also believe in the importance of delivering accurate data and predictions to the public. 
While we fell short of accomplishing that ultimate goal,
we hope that any future endeavours will be mindful about the impact and potential risk of their research outcome, 
and hope that this page could serve as a starting point for such future pursuits.
