## MODIS Fire Archieve
Fire records can be requested for download from the [FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) website](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/).
Place the downloaded csv file into `data/modis_fire`. 
You might have to modify `data_loader.py` to change the name of the file from which fire records will be loaded.
